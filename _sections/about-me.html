      <p>I'm a Computer Systems Engineer from Mexico City. <br> I have mainly worked on mobile development but since 2017 that I started a Master's
        in Computer Science I've focused on Machine Learning and Bioinformatics. <br>I am currently doing research on the potential of using 
        Machine Learning techniques to predict Zika virus epidemics as well as developing methods to assess the impact of human movement 
        in spreading vector-borne diseases.
